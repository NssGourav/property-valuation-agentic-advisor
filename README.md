# Intelligent Property Valuation Agentic Advisor 🏠

A high-performance hybrid AI/ML platform for real estate valuation. It pairs a deterministic Random Forest regressor with a stochastic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine to provide not just a price, but a grounded investment narrative.

## 🔗 Live Demo
**Access the application on Streamlit Cloud:** [Live Demo](https://property-valuation-agentic-advisor-xvfy6pzq5caq72fmxlzrak.streamlit.app/)

> [!NOTE]
> The hosted app is fully deployed and healthy, but anonymous public access to the root URL depends on the current Streamlit Cloud visibility settings. If you encounter an authentication screen, the backend/model remains fully verifiable via the `/healthz` health endpoint.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The core objective is to estimate property value from historical housing data and then explain that estimate with grounded, retrieval-backed investment advice.

## 📐 System Architecture
The system follows a **deterministic workflow** where ML predictions are enriched by a local knowledge base (retrieval) and summarized by a template-based advisor (no LLM dependencies).

### Core Components
- **Deterministic Brain (ML)**: A Random Forest model trained on historical housing data to provide baseline valuations.
- **Contextual Memory (RAG)**: A lightweight retrieval index over the local knowledge base that surfaces market trends and relevant notes.
- **Advisory Layer**: A template-based advisor that combines the ML estimate, retrieved context, and comparable sales.
- **Presentation Layer**: A professional Streamlit UI with PDF export capabilities for institutional-grade briefs.

## 🎯 Demo Guidance

### 1. The "Happy Path" (Standard Valuation)
- **Inputs**: 2500 sq ft, 3 Bedrooms, 2 Bathrooms, 2 Stories, Main Road: Yes, Parking: 2.
- **Expectation**: A realistic price estimate (~₹60L - ₹80L) and a professional AI breakdown of the property's investment potential.
- **Action**: Click "Download Investment Report (PDF)" to see the full brief.

### 2. The "Guardrail Path" (Outlier Detection)
- **Inputs**: 5000 sq ft, 1 Bedroom.
- **Expectation**: The `validator.py` will trigger a **Soft Warning** (Unusual area for bedrooms).
- **Benefit**: Demonstrates the system's ability to prevent "Garbage In, Garbage Out" scenarios.

### 3. The "Deterministic Path" (No API Key Needed)
- **Action**: Run the app without any LLM/API keys.
- **Expectation**: The app always generates an advisory summary using deterministic retrieval + simple decision rules.

## 📊 Model & Metrics
The model is trained on the [Kaggle Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset) (546 records).

| Metric | Random Forest | Linear Regression |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R² Score** | 0.582 | 0.627 |
| **MAE** | ₹1,080,958 | ₹999,836 |

> [!NOTE]
> While Linear Regression has a slightly higher R², Random Forest is chosen for the production "Advisor" path for its ability to capture non-linear feature interactions and provide **Feature Importance** insights.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Local Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NssGourav/property-valuation-agentic-advisor.git
cd property-valuation-agentic-advisor
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt 
```

### 2. Train the Model Locally
If `models/house_model.pkl` is missing, train the model:
```bash
python3 src/train_model.py
```
`models/house_model.pkl` is treated as a build artifact and is not committed to git.

### 3. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

### Environment Configuration
| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `KAGGLE_USERNAME` | Required if retraining the model from source. |

### Running Tests
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/
```

## 🌐 Deployment Status
The project maintains a healthy deployment on Streamlit Cloud. You can verify the operational status of the hosted app even if the root URL is set to private/authenticated:

- **Health Check**: [Verify Health Endpoint](https://property-valuation-agentic-advisor-xvfy6pzq5caq72fmxlzrak.streamlit.app/healthz)
  - Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`
- **Automated Smoke Check**:
  Verify deployment health and accessibility locally:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/check_streamlit_deployment.sh
  ```

## 🛡️ Robustness & Fallbacks
The system is designed to be resilient to missing dependencies:
- **No Groq API Key**: The app still runs perfectly for valuation. The advisor provides a "Fallback Mode" summary using raw retrieved context without LLM generation.
- **No Kaggle Credentials**: If `Housing.csv` is missing and download fails, clear instructions are provided for manual download.
- **Missing FAISS Index**: The system attempts to rebuild the index if source documents are present.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/app.py`: Streamlit frontend.
- `src/agent.py`: Template-based advisor (no LLM dependencies).
- `src/rag_engine.py`: Knowledge-base retrieval + comparable-sales matcher.
- `src/train_model.py`: ML pipeline (download -> preprocess -> tuning -> evaluation).
- `src/validator.py`: Input guardrails.
- `src/pdf_report.py`: Automated PDF reporting via ReportLab.

## 🛡️ Limitations & Roadmap
- **Current**: Static knowledge base in `comparable_sales.txt`.
- **Roadmap**: 
  - [ ] **Live Market Data**: Integration with real estate APIs for real-time comps.
  - [ ] **Interactive Maps**: Geographic visualization of target property vs. retrieved comps.
  - [ ] **Deep Learning**: Experimenting with XGBoost or Neural Networks for improved R².
